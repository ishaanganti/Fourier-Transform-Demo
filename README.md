# Fourier-Transform-Demo
Using MatPlotLib to employ FFT. 


A quick demonstration of how to implement a Fourier Transform in MatPlotLib. An example featuring an entered equation to Fourier Transform and one using a wav file are given, along with images of a successfully carried out Fourier Transform on a wav file. Note that the Fourier Transform used is the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), a complexity-efficient algorithm that uses the roots of unity.
